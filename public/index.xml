      <description>Method chaining in Javascript from wikipedia Method chaining, also known as named parameter idiom, is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages.
The key to achieve this is that each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.
A similar syntax is method cascading, where after the method call the expression evaluates to the current object, not the return value of the method.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>functional programming In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs— that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. To put it in a diferent way we can say that declarative programming cares about what to perform an action and imperative cares about how to perform that action</description>
